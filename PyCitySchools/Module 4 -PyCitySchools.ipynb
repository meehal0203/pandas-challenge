Lastly, charter schools vastly outperform district schools in all areas, sometimes by up to almost 40% higher grades although all of the district schools were considered large (had at least 2000 pupils). Wilson High School (a large charter school) still managed an overall passing rate of 95% while having a student body of almost 2300 children."
